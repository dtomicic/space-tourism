## Project task
Project task was to make a responsive website, with info hardcoded or pulled from a .JSON file.

## Project overview
I've decided to do the site with data pulling from .JSON as that seemed easier for me a bit, didn't really have any big problems, all went smoothly. Only little issue I stumbled upon is with some of the pictures not really being placed as I would like them, but that shouldn't be a hard fix in the future when I get around to it.
